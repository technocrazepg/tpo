        <p>The placement session 2019-20 was marked by the visit of the giants such as Flipkart, Meesho and Bounce to our campus for hiring the bright minds of the institute. Students have always waited for these organizations to visit and hire them. This is a great achievement for our campus as these all organizations offered a huge package of more than 20 LPA to the students. This achievement would not have been possible by the helping hands which were lended by our alumni notably: Paresh Goel, Abhishek Kumar Patel, Aniruddha Sharma and Subodh Jain who have remained a vital part of these organizations. The student volunteers have also persevered a lot in getting in touch with them and finally calling them to the campus. We hope that more of our alumni will be helping out our volunteers to call these esteemed companies to the campus and oblige our students with a high profile job which students target right from the beginning of their first year</p>
